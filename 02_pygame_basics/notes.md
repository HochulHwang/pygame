# constructor function  
* use Uppercase to differentiate with functions  
* ex) pygame.Rect() and pygame.Surface() are constructor functions that are in the pygame module  
```python  
import whammy # import module  
fizzy() # function  
egg = Wombat() # constructor function that returns an object. the object is saved as a variable  
egg.bluhbluh() # method call  
whammy.spam() # function call  
```
